Hello,

This BOA release provides three new PHP versions, system updates, including
security fixes, many bug fixes, latest Aegir version, plus all included
Drupal distributions updated to latest versions, and supplied with latest
Drupal 7 core, if possible.

@=> Important PHP versions availability changes

Still on PHP 5.6? You should switch to PHP 7.3 — It’s twice as fast as 5.6!

Note: BOA-4.0.0 release removes PHP 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 versions, if installed.
In addition to still supported, even if officially deprecated 5.6 and 7.0
versions, this release adds support for PHP 7.3, 7.2 and 7.1

Please check the PHP officially supported versions list at:
  http://php.net/supported-versions.php

In our limited testing Drupal 7 core version included in this release works
without noticeable issues with both PHP 7.2 and 7.3, although many contrib
modules may not be ready to switch your instance to 7.3 or 7.2 just yet,
especially if you have not used PHP 7.0 already.

We recommend to test your sites clones with newer PHP versions using BOA
multi-PHP-version support via ~/static/control/multi-fpm.info before
switching your instance to use 7.3 or 7.2 by default.

Please check for more information:
  https://learn.omega8.cc/how-to-quickly-switch-php-to-newer-version-330

We still include Pressflow 6 platforms, because in the meantime the LTS
community support made the latest Pressflow 6 version compatible with PHP 7.2

If you still have a reason to use Drupal 6 core, we recommend to use
our version: https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/tree/pressflow-plus

@=> Let's Encrypt certificates

If you are still running any Drupal site without Let’s Encrypt Free SSL
enabled in your Aegir control panel, you may want to read two articles:

  HTTPS' massive speed advantage: http://bit.ly/2b42lqV
  HTTP/2 makes media loading 3–15 times faster: http://bit.ly/2aW1u9V

The Let’s Encrypt certs are free, and very easy to use! Just follow the docs:

  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/SSL.txt

In short, here is all you need to do:

  1. Create ~/static/control/ssl-live-mode.info file, and wait a few minutes
  2. Edit any hosted site node to set SSL to "Enabled", and hit Save
  3. Repeat step #2 for every other site you host in Aegir

Congrats!

Now enjoy HTTPS with free Let’s Encrypt certs for all hosted sites, with
HTTP/2 for speed, and Perfect Forward Secrecy for security, auto-enabled!

Note: If you have used SSL add-on with dedicated IP address before,
you need to update DNS to point it to your instance default IP address,
which can be found in your (long) welcome email, in the section #2

@=> Speaking of docs. Be the change you want to see, and participate in
