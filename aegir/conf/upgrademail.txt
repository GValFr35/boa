Hello,

This BOA release provides three new PHP versions, system updates, including
security fixes, many bug fixes, latest Aegir version, plus all included
Drupal distributions updated to latest versions, and supplied with latest
Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 core, if possible. Yes, BOA still supports Pressflow 6.
Yes, we have added Solr 7 support and every 5 minutes updates!

Three Drupal 8 based popular distributions have been included by default,
plus much improved Composer support and automatic permissions-fix-magic
on Platform and Site Verify tasks. No more manual fixes!

By the way, Composer will now use PHP 7.2 by default, and you can find
many useful hints at:
  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/COMPOSER.txt

@=> Solr 7 and Solr 4 support changes and improvements

Big improvements and changes are coming to (auto)managing Solr cores too!
Solr cores are are now created every 5 minutes if needed, instead of during
the nightly procedure only, and Solr 7 is used by default. Existing Solr 4
cores will continue to work as before, but the system will create new Solr 7
cores for all compatible sites, and will update the sites/foo.com/solr.php
accordingly.

Both Solr 7 and Solr 4 powered by Jetty 9 server are available. Supported
integration modules are limited to latest versions of either search_api_solr
(D8/Solr7 and D7/Solr7 ) or apachesolr (D7/Solr4 and D6/Solr4).

Please read for more details:
  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/SOLR.txt

@=> Drupal 8 platforms and Composer support

Since BOA-4.0.0-prod three new Drupal 8 based platforms are included:

Lightning 3.2.5 -------------- https://drupal.org/project/lightning
Thunder 8.2.33 --------------- https://drupal.org/project/thunder
Varbase 8.6.4 ---------------- https://drupal.org/project/varbase

BOA supports Drupal 8 codebases both with classic directory structure like
in Drupal 7 and also Drupal 8 distros you can download from Drupal.org, but
if you use Composer based codebase with different structure, the platform path
is not the codebase root directory, but the subdirectory where you see the
Drupal own index.php and "core" subdirectory. It can be platform-name/web or
platform-name/docroot or something similar depending on the distro design.

Please read for more details:
  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt

@=> Important PHP versions availability changes

Still on PHP 5.6? You should switch to PHP 7.3 — It’s twice as fast as 5.6!
But don't switch blindly -- even sites already running on PHP 7.0 before
are most probably not ready for PHP 7.2 or 7.3 without proper fixes.

Note: BOA-4.0.0-prod release removes PHP 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5, if installed.
In addition to still supported, even if officially deprecated 5.6 and 7.0
versions, this release adds support for PHP 7.3, 7.2 and 7.1

Please check the PHP officially supported versions list at:
  http://php.net/supported-versions.php

In our limited testing Drupal 7 core version included in this release works
without noticeable issues with both PHP 7.2 and 7.3, although many contrib
modules may not be ready to switch your instance to 7.3 or 7.2 just yet,
especially if you have not used PHP 7.0 already.

We recommend to test your sites clones with newer PHP versions using BOA
multi-PHP-version support via ~/static/control/multi-fpm.info before
switching your instance to use 7.3 or 7.2 by default.

Please check for more information:
  https://learn.omega8.cc/how-to-quickly-switch-php-to-newer-version-330

We still include Pressflow 6 platforms, because in the meantime the LTS
community support made the latest Pressflow 6 version compatible with PHP 7.2

If you still have a reason to use Drupal 6 core, we recommend to use
our version: https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/tree/pressflow-plus

@=> Let's Encrypt certificates

If you are still running any Drupal site without Let’s Encrypt Free SSL
enabled in your Aegir control panel, you may want to read two articles:

  HTTPS' massive speed advantage: http://bit.ly/2b42lqV
  HTTP/2 makes media loading 3–15 times faster: http://bit.ly/2aW1u9V

The Let’s Encrypt certs are free, and very easy to use! Just follow the docs:

  https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/blob/master/docs/SSL.txt

In short, here is all you need to do:

  1. Create ~/static/control/ssl-live-mode.info file, and wait a few minutes
  2. Edit any hosted site node to set SSL to "Enabled", and hit Save
  3. Repeat step #2 for every other site you host in Aegir

Congrats!

Now enjoy HTTPS with free Let’s Encrypt certs for all hosted sites, with
HTTP/2 for speed, and Perfect Forward Secrecy for security, auto-enabled!

Note: If you have used SSL add-on with dedicated IP address before,
you need to update DNS to point it to your instance default IP address,
which can be found in your (long) welcome email, in the section #2

@=> Speaking of docs. Be the change you want to see, and participate in
@=> the BOA docs rewrite: http://bit.ly/2aK0Vli - your input is welcome!

Also, your Aegir instance has been upgraded to version boa.version
